{"name":"Text-analysis","tagline":"Text syntactic and semantic analysis","body":"# Ghib.li Human Language Analysis\r\n[Ghib.li](http://ghib.li) provides two state-of-the-art Human Language Analysis tools to perform syntactic and semantic analysis.\r\n\r\n[Syntactic analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parsing) is the process of analyzing human language into its constituents, for example, a sentence's subject and objects. Syntactic analysis can be used to extract the most relevant words of a sentence, which can save time and resources in the preparation of reports and dashboard.\r\n\r\n[Semantic analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Semantic_analysis_(linguistics)), which aim at finding the meaning of a sentence words, is more complex and less understood than syntactic analysis. State-of-the-art tools like Thomson Reuters' [OpenCalais](http://www.opencalais.com/) annotate text with a wealth of additional information, including topic, social tags and entities (e.g., companies, persons and countries). [Ghib.li](http://ghib.li) integrates OpenCalais in its services (a free OpenCalais service key is required) to streamline processes and facilitate the development of full-featured text processing tools.\r\n\r\nGo to the [Smart Text Classification Wiki](https://github.com/alessandrousseglioviretta/text-classification/wiki) and the [Human Text Analysis Wiki](https://github.com/alessandrousseglioviretta/text-analysis/wiki) for more details, or email info@ghib.li","google":"UA-38691001-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
